    "### Basic Rules\n",
    "1. The game begins with the player placing a bet. Note: you don't need to implement this in your blackjack program\n",
    "2. The dealer deals two cards to the player & self. Note: the dealer has one card facing up & one down\n",
    "3. The hand's value is the sum of card values. For example, 3 of ♠  K of ♥  = 13. Here are the card values in blackjack:\n",
    "    - 2-10 count as their pip value\n",
    "    - Jack, Queen & King count as 10\n",
    "    - Ace counts as 1 or 11\n",
    "4. The player is allowed to draw (hit) additional cards to improve their hand's value\n",
    "5. Once the player has completed their hand, it's the dealer's turn. Note: the dealer's hand will not be complete if the player has either busted (the hand's value exceeds 21) or received a blackjack (A of ♠  K of ♥)\n",
    "6. The dealer reveals the card facing down & must draw until the hand's value equals 17. The dealer must stand at 17 or higher\n",
    "7. The player wins by either:\n",
    "    - Not busting  & having a higher hand value than the dealer\n",
    "    - Not busting and having the dealer bust\n",
    "    - Receiving a blackjack & the dealer not receiving a blackjack\n",
    "8. If the player and dealer have the same hand value (not including blackjacks), this is called a push and the player typically doesn't win or lose on that hand"
